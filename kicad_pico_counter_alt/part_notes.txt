notes about parts

*for EEPROM:
Most "Microchip" parts set lower address bits to "don't care's" which is not desirable
need a  SOT-23-5 part where the address pins are set internally to "0" so use:

24AA64/24FC64/24LC64 (24AA64T-E/OT seems to be in stock frequently) or
24AA64F/24LC64F/24FC64F

only difference is write protect scheme, but write protect is not used anyway (tied to ground)

alternatively "SparkFun Qwiic EEPROM Breakout - 512Kbit" can be used, or no EEPROM chip (state not saved)

*for buffer / level converter:
Nexperia 74HC2G34GV,125 used because of small board size
TI CD74HC4050M96 also tested, but changed due to large board size

*for current sense / comparator, 
INA203AIDR, stocked at Mouser, but not Digikey
INA203AID also works (same thing) but seems to be even less stocked
